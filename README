Summation method 2 is enabled with the following commands:
	make clean
	make METHOD=-DM2

Method 2 adds ceil(n/lg(n)) groups of at most lg(n) integers each and
adds the results using method 1, as per instructions. 

All project-specific named constants are in one convenient location, 
constants.h, for easy modification.
